Course Description
Prerequisites: 2 years of programming experience (at Sunset High School this is through completion of Java Programming (CS161) or proficiency examination)

Welcome to C++ and Data Structures! We will be using the C++ Language to create applications, as well as learning theoretical and practical data structures for use in advanced programs.

There is no required textbook for this class; video tutorials and online reference will be used throughout the class. We will be using the gcc compiler through the Cygwin unix emulator. Cygwin is a free download, so you can work on a PC at home. There are also other compilers that can be used on a Mac.

We will have the following textbooks available for reference in class:

D.S. Malik, C++ Programming: From Problem Analysis To Program Design, Course Technology.

Russell Shackelford, An Introduction to Computing & Algorithms, Addison-Wesley.

Frank M. Carrano, Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with C++, Addison-Wesley

Sunset’s C++ and Data Structures class covers all the topics for Portland State University’s CS162 Introduction to Computer Science AND CS163 Data Structures, and students can earn college credit for the CS162 class. We will not be offering CS163 credit this year.

Synergy/Canvas Use
Canvas will house all of the main materials and lessons for this class.

I will give feedback and scores on assessments through Canvas. I encourage students and parents to check in on Canvas grades often and will demonstrate how to do so in class. Cumulative scores on each standard will be moved to Synergy prior to each progress report or report card.

Student Responsibilities
It is essential for students to be responsible for their own learning in class. This means being aware of assignment deadlines, staying on task during class, asking for help when needed, and maintaining good communication. The teacher will be available to support students, but will not micromanage each student’s choices. If a student needs clarification on assignment expectations, more skill demonstrations, alternate materials, or any other support, this must be communicated to the teacher as early as possible so adequate support can be given.

Late Work Policy
For each assignment, students are given a “soft deadline.” If students turn in a complete project before the soft deadline, they will get feedback on their project and have the opportunity to make improvements. The improved work can be turned in again to be regraded. There is also a “hard deadline” for the project when a project must be turned in. Any project turned in after the soft deadline but before the hard deadline will still be accepted, but there will be no chance for improvements. Work is not accepted after the hard deadline.

There is some flexibility in deadlines assuming that the student communicates with the teacher. This can be in person, but must be followed up via email. If a student knows they will be missing classes, they can make arrangements for an extended deadline if they communicate about the absence beforehand. All other extenuating circumstances will be dealt with on a case by case basis.

Multiple Opportunities
This class will provide multiple opportunities for students to demonstrate proficiency on each class standard. This is accomplished through having multiple assessments for each standard. Some assignments will be assessed on multiple standards. Assignment descriptions will indicate what standards are being assessed. In addition, there is the possibility of improving an assessment’s grade if it is turned in by the soft deadline (see Late Work Policy).

Flexibility Statement
The instructor reserves the right to modify course content and/or substitute assignments and learning activities in response to institutional, weather, or class situations.

Technology Use
Students are provided with all of the technology necessary to complete assignments during class. For some classes, this will include the use of Chromebooks, so please bring them charged and ready for use. We often use videos for instructional purposes, so make sure you bring your own headphones or earbuds. Students will follow all the guidelines on technology use outlined in the Student Handbook (Technology Misuse - Code 26).

Cell phones are not a part of technology use in our classrooms. They are expected to be off and away during class time. Playing video games is always a violation of technology use, regardless of which device is being used.

Student Conduct/Classroom Rules
Food & Drink - Sorry! This is a computer classroom - no food or drink. (Water is permitted if it stays away from the technology.)


Class equipment - Please be careful with class equipment. Missing or broken items are hard for us to replace! Please let a teacher know if something does break so we can fix or replace it! Also, please be mindful of waste! We do not have infinite amount of resources.  All materials used for class projects will be provided. Personal, outside of class, projects that use our materials will be charged a small fee dependent on materials and machine use. Ask your teacher about those prices.

Language - Like every class in the school, please use classroom-appropriate language and treat all students and staff with respect.

Music - Students will sometimes have the option to listen to music while working. Students must provide their own headphones/earbuds, only listen during independent work time, and music must be school-appropriate.

Plagiarism
All students will receive clarification and explanation of what Plagiarism is in a technology course, as well as examples of how to avoid it.

Student Agreement:

“I understand that plagiarism means copying someone else’s work and presenting the work as if it were my own, without clearly attributing the original author.

I understand that plagiarism is an act of intellectual dishonesty, and that people can be  kicked out of school or fired from their jobs if they get caught plagiarizing.

Aside from using open source libraries and short snippets of code which are clearly attributed to their original author, 100% of the code in my projects was written by me, or along with other students with whom I was programming in real time with teacher approval (and I have noted in the code where we have collaborated together).

I pledge that I did not plagiarize any of my work. I understand that my teacher will audit my projects to confirm this.”

In the situations where we discover instances of unambiguous plagiarism, the student will not receive credit for the plagiarized assignment. In addition, the student will be referred to the counseling and administrative departments in accordance with Sunset’s Student Handbook (Academic Integrity - Code 1).  

Instructional Materials
All instructional materials for this class are digital and will be provided via Canvas.

Students should bring:

Your Chromebook, charged and ready to use
A writing instrument
Headphones or earbuds
Course Grading Criteria
The grades for this class follow the grading scale for Portland State University. This class is a series of projects for you to complete individually (though some later projects may be done in teams). Each project has a set point value and projects must be done in order. Projects are ~50% of your grade, your practical (proficiency) midterm and practical (proficiency) final are ~25% combined, and your written midterm and written final are ~25% combined. At grade time, your accumulated points will determine your grade.

A : 90 - 100 %

B : 80 - 89 %

C : 70 - 79 %

D : 50 - 69 %

Class Standards
Follows Portland State University’s class standards.

Course Outline
CS162 introduces Computer Science using C++. Some of you coming into the course will already know C++, others will not. CS162 will provide introductory material regarding C++ for people that have already learned how to program in a high level programming language. In addition, CS162 provides an introduction to software design, use of a variety of data structures, data abstraction, and recursion.

CS163 introduces data abstraction with formal specification, and elementary algorithm analysis. Basic concepts of data and its representation inside a computer are included. Data structures emphasized include linear, linked, and orthogonal lists, tree structures, and graphs. Data structures are implemented as data abstractions. Sorting and searching strategies are covered along with overall data management.

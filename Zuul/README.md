Assignment: Zuul

Create a text-based adventure game using the example as a start.  All information will be text, and all commands must be typed in.  Rooms will typically have a description, and possibly items.  For example, you might have:

You are currently in the 1-20 lab at Sunset.  All the cool people are hanging out here.

There are exits:

WEST

There are no items in the room.

Then, if you type in WEST:

You are in one hall.  You see a computer lab to the east.  Wait; are they playing with robots in there?

There are exits:

NORTH SOUTH EAST

There is a MOP here.

 

Create a class for the room.  Create either a class or a struct for items.  Use a map (which is like a HashMap from Java) for the exits.

There must be at least 15 rooms, each of which tells you the exits.  (Rooms must be separate class and header files.) I recommend using a vector of room pointers.  (15 points)

There must be 5 items.  The rooms should tell you what items are in the room.  (15 points)

Items must be able to be picked up and put in a player inventory (10 points) and dropped into a room. (10 points)  The rooms should keep track of dropped items.

The game must have a winning condition and a way to quit.  (10 points)

Comments. Seriously. (10 points)

Total:  70 points

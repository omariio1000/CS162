Tic-Tac-Toe Assignment

 

A basic game: Tic-Tac-Toe

 

Overview:  Create a tic-tac-toe game using the command line. This will be a two-player game, rather than having an artificial intelligence.

 

Interface:  Output the tic-tac-toe grid in the command line.  Input your move on the command line.  Keep track of how many times X wins and O wins.

 

Implementation:  Use a grid with letters and numbers to allow the user to enter a move.  Represent it internally with a two dimensional array. (10 points)

 

Example:

1	2	3
a	X		
b		X	O
c	O		
 

Have the user enter a move, check to see if the move is legal, and enter the move if it is legal.  (10 points)  Start with X.  After each move, check to see if the board contains a win or a tie.  Reset the board and show winning totals if they win/tie.  (10 points)  Then redraw the board.

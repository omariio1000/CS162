Palindrome

 

The Idea

Create a program that will read in a series of characters; only read in 80 characters at most.  Remove all spaces and punctuation.  (20 points)  Check to see if the input is the same backwards as it is forwards. If it is a palindrome (the same backwards and forwards), print “Palindrome”.  If not, print “Not a palindrome.” (20 points) Make sure that you make all of the letters the same case before comparing! You may include numbers, but nothing beyond alphanumeric characters.

 

DO NOT USE STRINGS FOR THIS PROJECT. 

You may use the <cstring> library, including strcmp, strlen, strcpy.

 

Example:

A dog, a plan, a canal: pagoda.

Palindrome.

 

This is not a palindrome.

Not a palindrome.

 

Implementation

Read in from cin into a character array.  Don’t forget to remove punctuation and spaces!  You probably want to create a second character array, and put all the characters in backwards.  Compare the two arrays, and see if they are the same.

There are a number of ways to implement this, so I’m going to leave the implementation details to you.
